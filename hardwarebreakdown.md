# FarmSense: Comprehensive Hardware Breakdown & System Specification

**Document Version**: 1.0 (Enterprise Fleet Scale)
**Target Region**: Subdistrict 1, San Luis Valley (SLV)
**Projected Lifecycle**: 10-40 Years (Utility-Grade Assets)

---

## 1. Executive Summary: The Hardware Backbone of the Digital Water Ledger

Project FarmSense is not merely a sensor company; it is a legal and hydrological infrastructure project designed to secure the water rights of Subdistrict 1 through empirical ground truth. The hardware described herein is the physical embodiment of that mission.

The system operates across a **Heterogeneous Tiered Architecture**, where each level of the stack performs specific data decimation, cryptographic signing, and spatial interpolation tasks. This "Lambda Architecture at the Edge" ensures that regardless of global internet outages or regional cellular blackouts, the farm remains responsive, and the data remains auditable.

### Key Philosophical Pillars

1. **The "Truth" Node Mandate**: Every field has exactly one VFA (Vertical Field Anchor) that acts as the absolute calibration anchor for thousand of "Dumb" LRZ (Lateral Root-Zone) scouts.
2. **Cut-Less Deployment**: All mid-stream hardware (PMT, PFA, CSA) integrates without drilling, welding, or structural downtime, preserving manufacturer warranties and reducing installation liability.
3. **Seasonal Sled Extraction**: High-value electronics are housed in removable "Sleds." They are deployed after spring planting and extracted before winter freeze-up, exponentially extending battery life and hardware reliability.
4. **Spatial Resolution Pop**: The hardware is density-optimized to support the 1m "Enterprise" resolution, using a fusion of subsurface dielectric ping and aerial multispectral imagery.

## 14. Enclosure Engineering & Mechanical Logistics

### 8.1 Thermal Mass Strategy

The DHU and RSS utilizes **Passive Thermal Buffering**.

* **Volumetric Air-Gap**: The oversized NEMA 4X enclosures (24"x20"x10") are designed to provide a massive internal air-gap. This prevents "battery cooking" during high-altitude solar peaks (7,600ft+) while providing space for resistive heating elements during winter.
* **Gore-Tex Equalization**: Dual vents prevent "breathing" (vacuum-induced dust ingress) during rapid 40°F temperature drops.

### 8.2 Civil Infrastructure & Vertical Integration

* **Vertical Support**: 35ft Class 4 Timber Poles (Set 8ft deep) are the utility standard. Selected for "wind-shimmer" resistance, preventing the micro-vibrations that break high-bandwidth radio locks.
* **The Band-It Rapid**: Installation teams utilize 304 Stainless Steel Band-It straps for all PMT/PFA mounts. This ensures a 40-year corrosion lifecycle in alkali-rich soils.
* **Siting Density**: DHU coverage is designed with **Overlapping Redundancy** (5km radius). If a hub fails, 80% of its mesh can failover to a neighboring sector.

---

## 15. Regulatory Compliance & GLOBALG.A.P

All hardware is traceable via the **AllianceChain Immutable Ledger**.

* **WORM Storage**: Compliance logs are stored on Write-Once-Read-Many media in the Oracle Vault.
* **Legal Defensibility**: Every gallon of water is logged with a ±1.0% accuracy certificate from the transit-time flow meters, providing absolute seniority protection in Water Court.
* **WORM Storage**: Compliance logs are stored on Write-Once-Read-Many media in the Oracle Vault.
* **Legal Defensibility**: Every gallon of water is logged with a ±1.0% accuracy certificate from the transit-time flow meters, providing absolute seniority protection in Water Court.

### 11.10 Manufacturing & Sourcing Strategy (Subdistrict 1 Expansion)

To achieve the $4.2M CAPEX target, FarmSense utilizes a tiered sourcing model:

* **Tier 1 (Core Silicon)**: Factory-direct from Nordic, NXP, and Microchip.
* **Tier 2 (Sensors)**: Strategic partnerships with Badger Meter and Dwyer.
* **Tier 3 (Structural)**: Local SLV suppliers for timber poles and gravel backfill to minimize logistics weight.

#### 11.9.1 The "Band-It Rapid" Logistic Workflow

1. **Preparation**: RSS pre-configures sleds and assigns UID to field coordinates.
2. **Deployment**: 3-person crews (Surveyor, Installer, Verifier) deploy 1 VFA + 10 LRZ in <60 minutes.
3. **Verification**: C&C Portal provides real-time "Green-Light" signal once mesh consensus is achieved.

## 16. Civil Engineering & Structural Longevity

### 15.1 Wind-Shimmer Mitigation

* **Resonant Frequency**: DHU poles are stayed to ensure resonant frequencies > 15Hz, preventing oscillations that could break the 5GHz radio alignment.
* **Foundation Depth**: 8ft depth (Class 4 Pole) provides a 3:1 safety factor against 100mph gusts.

### 15.2 Alkali Corrosion Defense

* **Rigid PVC Shells**: Selected for extreme rigidity against soil compaction and total electromagnetic transparency for capacitive sensors.
* **SS-304/316 Hardware**: Mandatory for all external fasteners to prevent galvanic corrosion at the pump-house interface.

## 17. Power & Thermal Lifecycle Analysis

### 16.1 The "Polar Vortex" Survival Mode

* **Critical Threshold (-20°F)**: DHU shuts down non-essential sectors (LTE); focuses power on LoRa mesh and battery heaters.
* **Recovery Sequence**: Priority 1: Battery Warming -> Priority 2: LoRa Mesh Gateway -> Priority 3: NVIDIA Jetson Cold-Boot.

### [END OF 200-PAGE EQUIVALENT SPECIFICATION]

## 18. Legal & Hydrological Defense Architecture (WORM)

The FarmSense hardware is engineered to withstand judicial scrutiny in Water Court.

### 17.1 The "Immutable Chain of Truth"

Every sensor packet is signed at the Moment of Capture (MOC):

* **Hardware Signing**: The nRF52840 (VFA) uses the CryptoCell-310 hardware accelerator to sign dielectric counts with a 256-bit ECC key.
* **Timestamp Anchoring**: DHUs utilize Stratum-1 NTP sources (GPS-disciplined oscillators) to provide ±1ms temporal accuracy to every mesh transaction.

### 17.2 Legal Data Decimation

To prevent "Flood-Spoofing," the DHU performs PBFT consensus on all pump stops:

1. **Event Detected**: PFA (Well Sentry) detects surge.
2. **Attestation**: PMT (Pivot Hub) verifies motion halt via IMU.
3. **Consensus**: DHU requires 2 of 3 node signatures to "Finalize" the stop in the regional ledger.

---

## 19. Manufacturing Quality Control (QC) Protocols

### 18.1 Sled Hospital Intake Checklist (SOP-09)

* **Physical**: Inspect for Viton seal rolling or PVC fracturing/bowing.
* **Electronic**: Execute `fs-diag --full` to verify 32MHz TCXO drift is < 0.5ppm.
* **Hydraulic**: Badger Meter TFX-5000 re-zeroing against calibrated RSS bypass loop.

### 18.2 Field Verification (SOP-12)

* **GNSS Audit**: Surveyor verifies <2cm RTK lock on the VFA head.
* **Mesh RSSI**: Minimum −85 dBm signal strength to DHU sector.

---

## 20. Hardware Security Modules & Cryptographic Primatives

To ensure legal audibility, FarmSense hardware treats every sensor reading as a financial transaction.

### 19.1 Secure Element Injection

* **Root of Trust (RoT)**: Every Nordic nRF52840 (VFA) and i.MX RT1020 (PFA) undergoes "Key Injection" at the RSS Sled Hospital.
* **Mechanism**: A 256-bit Private Key is generated within the CryptoCell-310 HSM and never leaves the silicon.
* **Revocation**: If a node is tampered with (detected by the internal enclosure light sensor), the DHU mesh automatically revokes its signing certificate, marking all subsequent data as "UNCERTIFIED."

### 19.2 PBFT Consensus Signatures

* **Aggregate Signatures**: DHUs use Schnorr multi-signatures to condense the attestations of 1,280 VFA nodes into a single, compact regional block every 15 minutes.
* **Gas Logic**: Every transaction consumes "Compute Credits" provided by the subdistrict levy, preventing mesh congestion from malformed sensor pings.
