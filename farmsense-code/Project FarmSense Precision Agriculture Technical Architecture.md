Project Name: FarmSense | Document Type: Technical Architecture Specification | Version:


1.0 | Date: February 2026

# **Project FarmSense Architecture** **Specification**


## **1. Executive Summary & System Overview**

Project FarmSense is a full-stack precision agriculture application designed to


bridge the gap between raw field telemetry and actionable regulatory compliance.


The system ingests data from heterogeneous sources—soil sensors, pump


telemetry, weather stations, and satellite imagery—to compute high-resolution virtual


sensor networks. By leveraging a dual-layer compute architecture (Edge 20m grid vs.


Cloud 1m grid), FarmSense delivers real-time operational insights for farmers while


ensuring rigorous audit-ready logging for regulatory bodies.


Key Objectives:


Precision: Downscaling satellite and sparse sensor data to a 1m resolution grid.


Responsiveness: Utilizing an adaptive recalculation engine that shifts between


12-hour trends and critical 1-minute updates.


Compliance: Automating SLV 2026 regulatory reporting with non-repudiable


audit logs.

## **2. System Architecture Overview**


The FarmSense platform utilizes a tiered Lambda architecture extended to the edge.


This hybrid approach ensures low latency for field operations while maintaining the


immense computational capacity required for high-resolution spatial interpolation in


the cloud.

## **3. Data Layer Architecture**

The data layer handles the ingestion, validation, and storage of high-velocity time

series data and high-volume geospatial rasters.


**Data Sources & Ingestion**






















|Source|Protocol|Frequency|Data Type|
|---|---|---|---|
|Soil Moisture<br>Probes|MQTT / LoRaWAN|15 min|Volumetric Water Content (2<br>depths)|
|Vertical<br>Profling<br>Sensors|MQTT / LoRaWAN|30 min|Multi-depth moisture profle (4-<br>8 levels)|
|Pump<br>Telemetry|Modbus TCP /<br>MQTT|Real-time (1-5<br>sec)|Flow rate, Power status,<br>Pressure, Voltage|

|Landsat 8/9|USGS Earth Explorer<br>API|16 days|Thermal/Optical (Historical<br>baseline, 2013-present)|



**Data Preprocessing Pipeline**


Raw data undergoes a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline before storage:


1. Quality Control: Flagging out-of-range values, stuck sensors, and


communication errors.


2. Temporal Alignment: Synchronizing data from different sources to common


timestamps.


3. Atmospheric Correction: Sentinel-2 imagery processed with Sen2Cor for


surface reflectance.


4. Cloud Masking: Automated cloud detection using QA bands and ML-based


classifiers.


5. Landsat Index Computation: Pre-computing NDVI, NDMI, LST (Land Surface


Temperature) for calibration.


## **4. Edge Computing Layer (20m Grid)**

The edge layer is designed to operate with intermittent connectivity. It processes raw


telemetry locally to generate a coarse 20m virtual grid, ensuring farmers have


visibility even if the cloud connection is severed.


**4.1 Edge Hardware Specifications**














|Component|Specification|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|Compute<br>Module|Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) or NVIDIA<br>Jetson Nano|Main processing unit for local grid<br>computation|
|Storage|64GB Industrial microSD + 128GB<br>SSD|OS, application, 30-day data buffer|
|Connectivity|4G LTE modem + Ethernet backup|Cloud synchronization and remote<br>monitoring|
|Sensor<br>Interface|LoRaWAN Gateway (8-channel) +<br>MQTT broker|Collect data from feld sensors|
|Power|12V DC with UPS backup (6hr<br>capacity)|Continuous operation during power<br>outages|



**4.2 Edge Processing Architecture**


Local Compute Engine: Lightweight IDW (Inverse Distance Weighting)


interpolation for 20m grid.


Data Buffer: SQLite database storing 30 days of telemetry with automatic


compression.


Alert Engine: Rule-based system for critical condition detection (moisture <


wilting point).


Synchronization: "Store and Forward" mechanism with exponential backoff retry


logic.


Conflict Resolution: Timestamp-based priority; cloud-generated data takes


precedence.


**4.3 Edge Software Stack**


Language: Go (compiled binary ~15MB) for minimal footprint and fast startup.


Local Web Server: Embedded HTTP server for local dashboard access via farm


WiFi.


Sensor Drivers: Modbus RTU/TCP, MQTT client libraries for diverse sensor


integration.


Containerization: Docker Compose for easy deployment and updates.

## **5. Cloud Computing Layer (1m Grid)**


The cloud layer performs heavy-lifting spatial statistics to generate the 1m precision


grid required for SLV 2026 compliance.


**5.1 Interpolation Methodology**


We employ a hybrid Regression Kriging approach:


1. Trend Component: Derived from high-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2


NDVI at 10m resolution) which provides the spatial structure.


2. Residual Component: Derived from ground sensors (soil moisture) using


Ordinary Kriging to correct the satellite bias.


3. Uncertainty Quantification: Kriging variance provides confidence intervals for


each 1m cell.


4. Result: A 1m resolution soil moisture map that respects both local


measurements and field heterogeneity.

**5.3 Batch vs Real-time Processing**










|Processing<br>Type|Use Case|Technology|Latency|
|---|---|---|---|
|Real-time<br>Stream|Sensor data ingestion, critical<br>alerts|Apache Flink / Kafka<br>Streams|< 5 seconds|
|Micro-batch|Active mode recalculation (15-<br>min window)|Spark Structured<br>Streaming|5-15<br>minutes|
|Batch|Satellite imagery processing,<br>historical analysis|Apache Airfow + Dask|Hours to<br>days|



**5.4 Scalability Architecture**


Horizontal Scaling: Kubernetes auto-scaling based on queue depth and CPU


metrics.


Geographic Partitioning: Data partitioned by field ID for parallel processing.


Caching Layer: Redis cluster for frequently accessed grid tiles (dashboard).


CDN Integration: Pre-rendered Mapbox Vector Tiles cached at CloudFront edge


locations.


## **6. Adaptive Recalculation Engine**

To optimize compute costs and responsiveness, the system does not recalculate


grids on a fixed schedule. Instead, it uses a state-machine based approach with


event-driven triggers.


**6.1 Recalculation Modes**
















|Mode|Trigger Condition|Recalculation<br>Window|Action|
|---|---|---|---|
|Stable|Variance < 5% over 6 hours|12 Hours|Background batch<br>update|
|Active|Pump Status = ON or Rain ><br>2mm|15 Minutes|Standard grid update|
|Critical|Moisture < Wilting Point or<br>Pump Failure|1 Minute|Priority queue<br>processing + SMS Alerts|
|Out-of-<br>Turn|Unexpected sensor swing<br>(>20% change in 30 min)|Immediate|Recalculate affected<br>feld only|



**6.2 Judgment-Based Logic Implementation**


The adaptive engine uses a combination of rules and trend analysis:


# Pseudocode for Mode Transition Logic
def calculate_next_interval(field_id):
recent_variance = calculate_variance(field_id, window='6h')
pump_status = get_pump_status(field_id)
rainfall = get_rainfall(field_id, window='1h')
moisture_current = get_moisture(field_id)


if moisture_current < WILTING_POINT or pump_status == 'FAILED':
return MODE_CRITICAL, interval=60 # 1 minute


if pump_status == 'ON' or rainfall > 2.0: # mm
return MODE_ACTIVE, interval=900 # 15 minutes


if recent_variance < 0.05: # Stable field
return MODE_STABLE, interval=43200 # 12 hours


# Default: moderate monitoring


return MODE_ACTIVE, interval=1800 # 30 minutes


**6.3 Event-Driven Triggers**


Sensor Anomaly: Multiple consecutive out-of-range readings trigger immediate


recalculation.


Pump State Change: Transition from OFF to ON initiates Active mode for next 2


hours.


Extreme Weather: Heavy rainfall (>10mm/hr) or high winds trigger Critical


mode.


Satellite Update: New Sentinel-2 imagery arrival triggers batch recalibration.


**6.4 Configuration Management**


All thresholds are configurable per field or crop type via admin dashboard:


Wilting point moisture level (crop-specific)


Variance threshold for Stable mode (soil texture-dependent)


Rainfall trigger level (climate zone-adjusted)


Alert notification channels (SMS, email, push)

## **7. Database Schema Design**


**7.1 Time-Series Schema (TimescaleDB)**


CREATE TABLE sensor_readings (
time    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
device_id  UUID NOT NULL,
field_id  UUID NOT NULL,
sensor_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'moisture_10cm', 'moisture_30cm', 'flow_rate
value    DOUBLE PRECISION,
quality_score FLOAT,   -- 0.0 to 1.0 confidence
metadata  JSONB,    -- Additional sensor-specific data
PRIMARY KEY (time, device_id, sensor_type)
);


-- Hypertable conversion for automatic time-based partitioning
SELECT create_hypertable('sensor_readings', 'time');


-- Create indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_sensor_field_time ON sensor_readings (field_id, time DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_sensor_type_time ON sensor_readings (sensor_type, time DESC


-- Retention policy: keep raw data for 3 years, then aggregate
SELECT add_retention_policy('sensor_readings', INTERVAL '3 years');


**7.2 Spatial Grid Schema (PostGIS)**





**7.3 Compliance & Audit Schema (PostgreSQL)**


CREATE TABLE compliance_logs (
id     UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
field_id  UUID REFERENCES fields(id),
log_time  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
event_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'IRRIGATION_EVENT', 'VIOLATION', 'CALIBRATIO
details   JSONB NOT NULL,
hash    VARCHAR(64), -- SHA-256 hash for tamper detection
previous_hash VARCHAR(64), -- Blockchain-style chaining
user_id   UUID REFERENCES users(id),


**7.5 Data Partitioning Strategy**

**15.3 Testing Strategy**


**Unit Testing**


Python (Backend/ML): PyTest with 80%+ coverage target


# Example: pytest for interpolation algorithm
def test_regression_kriging():


sensor_data = create_mock_sensor_data()
satellite_data = create_mock_satellite_raster()


result = regression_kriging(sensor_data, satellite_data, grid_resolu


assert result.shape == (100, 100) # Expected grid size
assert 0 <= result.all() <= 1   # Moisture values in valid range
assert result.uncertainty.mean() < 0.1 # Reasonable uncertainty


Go (Edge Module): Standard testing package with table-driven tests


// Example: Go test for IDW interpolation
func TestIDWInterpolation(t *testing.T) {
tests := []struct {
name   string
sensors []SensorReading
expected float64
}{
{"single sensor", []SensorReading{{Lat: 0, Lon: 0, Value: 0.5}},
{"multiple sensors", []SensorReading{{Lat: 0, Lon: 0, Value: 0.3
}


for _, tt := range tests {
t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
result := IDWInterpolate(tt.sensors, Point{Lat: 0.5, Lon: 0.
if math.Abs(result-tt.expected) > 0.01 {
t.Errorf("Expected %f, got %f", tt.expected, result)
}
})
}
}


JavaScript (Frontend): Jest + React Testing Library


// Example: React component test
test('renders field status with correct color', () => {
const field = { id: '1', status: 'CRITICAL', moisture: 0.15 };
render();


const statusElement = screen.getByTestId('field-status');
expect(statusElement).toHaveClass('status-critical');
expect(statusElement).toHaveTextContent('CRITICAL');


});


**Integration Testing**


API Integration Tests: Test database with pytest-postgresql


@pytest.fixture
def test_db():
# Setup test database with schema
db = setup_test_database()
yield db
teardown_test_database(db)


def test_ingestion_endpoint(test_db, test_client):
response = test_client.post('/api/v1/ingest/telemetry', json={
'device_id': 'test-device-1',
'timestamp': '2023-10-15T14:30:00Z',
'readings': [{'sensor_type': 'moisture_10cm', 'value': 0.28}]
})


assert response.status_code == 202


# Verify data persisted in database
reading = test_db.query(SensorReading).first()
assert reading.value == 0.28


Kafka Integration: Testcontainers for integration tests with message queues


Database Migration Tests: Validate schema migrations don't break existing data


**End-to-End Testing**


Frontend E2E: Cypress for critical user flows


describe('Farmer Dashboard', () => {
it('should display field heatmap and allow zoom', () => {
cy.visit('/dashboard');
cy.login('farmer@test.com', 'password');


cy.get('[data-testid="field-map"]').should('be.visible');
cy.get('[data-testid="field-1"]').click();
cy.get('[data-testid="field-details"]').should('contain', 'Field 1')


// Verify map interaction


Stress Testing: Identify breaking points (max throughput, memory limits)


Endurance Testing: 24-hour soak tests to detect memory leaks
