## V1.75 Additions — New Primary Views

### 1. Live Platform Intelligence Terminal

A Bloomberg-style real-time operational data terminal designed to make the platform's live scale viscerally real to investors.

**Key elements:**

- **Live Counter Grid** — Six auto-refreshing counters, large and centered: Active Hardware Nodes, Acres Under Live Monitoring, Sensor Readings Ingested (today), Compliance Reports Filed (this year), Water Saved m³ (this season), and System Uptime %.
- **Real-Time Ingestion Feed** — Scrolling live feed of sensor batch ingestion events: timestamp, field ID (anonymized), reading count, and processing time. Updates every 15 seconds with actual data throughput numbers.
- **Network Status Map** — Miniaturized version of the mesh topology showing live node activity across all deployed subdistricts. Color-coded by region.
- **Incident & Anomaly Feed** — Live stream of anomaly detection events as they fire across the basin. Each event shows: type, confidence score, regulatory escalation status. Demonstrates the forensic intelligence operating in real time.
- **Platform Milestones Ticker** — Each time a new record is broken (new acres enrolled, highest single-day ingestion, etc.), a celebratory milestone banner fires.

### 2. Revenue Engine Deep-Dive

Detailed breakdown of the Resolution Pop monetization funnel with full SaaS analytics.

**Key elements:**

- **Conversion Funnel Visualization** — End-to-end funnel from Free (Silas Tier) → Basic → Pro → Enterprise. Shows absolute counts, conversion rates between each step, and average time-to-convert. Overlays the grant-subsidy effect: what percentage of free users convert to paid after their subsidy expires.
- **ARPU & MRR Waterfall** — Monthly chart of MRR broken out by tier. Net MRR movement month-over-month (new MRR, expansion MRR, contraction MRR, churned MRR). ARPU trend per tier.
- **Cohort Retention Analysis** — Cohort retention table showing how each monthly sign-up cohort retains across months 1–12. Identifies which cohorts have the highest retention (likely grant-program cohorts) vs. organic.
- **CAC vs. LTV by Channel** — Customer acquisition cost vs. lifetime value broken out by acquisition channel: grant program, direct outreach, regulatory referral, academic partnership. LTV:CAC ratio highlighted per channel.
- **Grant-Subsidy Revenue Bridge** — Shows the transition from subsidy-dependent revenue to self-sustaining ARR as grant programs mature. Projects the inflection point where platform revenue exceeds subsidy dependency.

### 3. Carbon & Water Asset Exchange

Full portfolio view of the FSN-CARBON and FSN-WATER derivative instruments generated and verified by the platform.

**Key elements:**

- **Live Asset Prices** — Real-time price charts for FSN-CARBON (Carbon Farming Standard credits, $/tonne) and FSN-WATER (verified acre-inch conservation credits, $/acre-inch). 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day price histories.
- **Credit Generation Model** — Visual explanation of how credits are generated: verified water conservation (acre-inches saved vs. historical baseline) → PBFT-confirmed and officer-validated → issued as tradeable FSN-WATER credit. Same pipeline for carbon via soil carbon sequestration proxy estimates from the NDVI trend.
- **Platform Credit Portfolio** — Total credits generated to date across all enrolled farms. Annual credit issuance trajectory. Current market value of all outstanding credits at spot price.
- **Projected Annual Yield** — Based on current enrolled acreage, average conservation rate, and credit price trend: projected credit revenue for next 12 months. Sensitivity range (low/mid/high price scenario).
- **Secondary Market Activity** — Trade volume, unique buyer/seller count, and liquidity metrics for the credit exchange. Supports the narrative of a functioning, liquid market for platform-generated assets.

### 4. Sovereign Expansion War Room

Interactive stage-gated expansion roadmap visualization from regional pilot to global water infrastructure.

**Key elements:**

- **Stage Map** — Four concentric rings or a linear stage diagram: Stage 1 (San Luis Valley Pilot) → Stage 2 (Colorado Statewide / DWR Integration) → Stage 3 (National — USDA/USGS / High Plains Aquifer) → Stage 4 (Sovereign Global — Australia, Brazil, UN Water Security). Each stage is clickable.
- **Stage Detail Panels** — For each stage: required hardware node count, target enrolled acres, required regulatory milestones (e.g., "DWR Rule-Compliant designation"), projected ARR at stage completion, and current progress bars.
- **Policy Risk Heatmap** — For each target jurisdiction: a color-coded risk score across: regulatory receptivity, water rights legal framework compatibility, existing competitor presence, and infrastructure (power/connectivity) availability. Helps investors understand where and why the expansion path is sequenced as it is.
- **Timeline with Capital Requirements** — Gantt-style timeline showing each stage's projected start/end date alongside the capital deployment milestones required to achieve it. Clearly maps Series A proceeds to specific expansion outcomes.
- **International G2G Status** — Government-to-government treaty discussion tracker: which countries have had preliminary discussions, who initiated contact, and what the proposed framework looks like.

### 5. IP & Competitive Moat Analysis

Complete intellectual property registry and competitive differentiation matrix.

**Key elements:**

- **Patent Portfolio Registry** — Catalogue of all filed and granted patents: algorithm patents (Regression Kriging workflow, EBK implementation), hardware design IP (kinetic penetrator geometry, HPC cold-start capacitor design, FHSS 128-bit frequency-hopping schema), and trade secrets (MAD threshold calibration constants, CU model coefficients). Filing dates, countries, and legal status.
- **Moat Analysis Matrix** — Side-by-side competitive comparison. Rows: key differentiating capabilities (hardware-signed immutable ledger, 1m Kriging resolution, PBFT water trading, FHSS LPI, FHE capability, Water Court admissibility, Reflex offline autonomy). Columns: FarmSense vs. named competitors (Climate Corp, Trimble Ag, Arable, Planet Labs, Ag Leader). Binary or scored comparison cells with a source footnote for each claim.
- **Trade Secret Classification** — Summary of what is patent-protected vs. trade-secret-protected vs. copyright-protected. Shows the legal strategy behind each protection mechanism.
- **IP Defense Timeline** — Milestones for IP: pending patent approvals, continuation applications, PCT international filings. Shows which IP rights will strengthen the moat over the next 12–36 months.

### 6. DoD / ESTCP Dual-Use Revenue Simulator

Investor-facing model of the defense contract revenue potential of the FarmSense network.

**Key elements:**

- **Node Qualification Counter** — Current count of hardware nodes that qualify for DoD/ESTCP programs based on: FHSS LPI/LPD capability, FHE-capable RSS units, JADC2-compatible mesh topology, and air-deliverable kinetic penetrator qualification.
- **Program Pipeline Model** — Structured view of the ESTCP contract pipeline: program name, program office, contract type (R&D, pilot, production), estimated contract value range, and FarmSense's competitive positioning. Not binding — clearly labelled as projections for scenario modeling.
- **Revenue Scenario Sliders** — Investor can adjust: % of FHSS-qualified nodes contracted by DoD, ESTCP R&D pilot award probability, and FHE RSS unit deployment count. Revenue model recalculates in real time showing notional contract values under each scenario.
- **Civilian-to-Defense Handoff Narrative** — Visual timeline showing how civilian deployment milestones (Subdistrict 1 proof, Colorado DWR approval) create the validation record that enables DoD procurement. Explains why civilian revenue is the on-ramp to defense revenue.

## Design Notes

- **Authentication:** The Investor Terminal uses a separate, higher-assurance authentication pathway (MFA required) compared to the public landing page. All sessions are logged with IP, device fingerprint, and duration.
- **Data Sensitivity:** All financial projections are clearly labelled as forward-looking estimates based on current trajectories. No guarantee language.
- **Visual Identity:** Maintains the Bloomberg-terminal aesthetic from V1 — dark background, monospaced financial data, live tickers. The new views extend this language rather than departing from it.
