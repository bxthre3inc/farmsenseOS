# Phase 1: Root Project Documentation & Configuration - Audit Log

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 reviewed the core directives and structural artifacts of the FarmSense project. The system is designed as a highly deterministic, anti-AI (in the critical path) precision agriculture platform targeted at preventing aquifer depletion in the San Luis Valley. Its explicit goal is to provide a cryptographically secure, legally defensible "Digital Water Ledger" capable of standing as empirical evidence in Colorado Water Court.

## Documentation Accuracy & Alignment

- **Narrative Consistency**: Excellent. Across `AGENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `SPRINT.md`, and business specs (`Subdistrict_1_Market_Intelligence.md`, `reference/` audits), the financial strategy and hardware definitions are perfectly aligned. All highlight the shift from a massive "Blitz" to a targeted 2-field pilot with CSU SLV Research Center.
- **Hardware Architecture**: Clearly defined tiered architecture (LRZ -> VFA -> PMT -> DHU -> RSS/Cloud).
- **Deployment Strategy**: A "Split Deployment" is highlighted in `CI_CD_SETUP.md` utilizing RDC (Master DB) and Zo.computer (Compute and portals).

## Architectural Gaps & Contradictions Identified

1. **Telemetry Disconnects**:
   - The VFA requires 900MHz LoRa to transmit to the DHU, but the DHU was spec'd with only 5GHz LTU radios. The DHU BOM needs a 900MHz gateway.
   - The VFA lacked a 2.4GHz receiver to listen to PFA Sentry nodes.
   *We will need to check the codebase to see how these disjointed telemetry paths are handled logically.*
2. **Computational Overhead at the Edge**:
   - The PMT runs Empirical Bayesian Kriging natively on a Cortex-M4 (120MHz).
   - The DHU runs 10m/20m Kriging on an **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (8GB)**.
   *We will heavily audit the `backend/` and `edge-compute/` components to see if these intensive geostatistical operations are truly optimized or just placeholder logic.*
3. **Audit Overrides**: The script `verify_audit_override.py` models Tiered SaaS access, indicating that the backend APIs enforce access based on Roles (FARMER vs AUDITOR) and Tiers (FREE vs PRO).

## Next Steps

Phase 1 is complete. Moving to Phase 2: `farmsense-code` Root & Specs.
