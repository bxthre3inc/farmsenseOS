# FarmSense: Software & Firmware Ecosystem Specifications

This document serves as the master index for the FarmSense deterministic operations platform. It maps out the technical specifications for all frontend portals, backend infrastructure, and the firmware logic operating on each hardware node.

## 🖥️ Frontend Software Specifications

> **Architecture Note (2026-03-05):** FarmSense has transitioned from **8 separate containerized portals (Gen 1)** to a **single unified React app with RBAC (Gen 2)**. The `farmsense-portal/` directory is the active unified portal. The 8 legacy SPECIFICATION.md files below now serve as **role-specific requirements documents** (what each view should contain), not independent app specs.
>
> See [`farmsense-portal/README.md`](frontend/farmsense-portal/README.md) for the full transition details.

### Active Unified Portal

- **[farmsense-portal](frontend/farmsense-portal/README.md)** — Single React/Vite app with JWT-scoped RBAC. Consolidates all 8 role views into one deployment at `brodiblanco.zo.computer/farmsense/`.

### Legacy Role Requirements (Use as feature input for unified portal)

1. **[Farmer Dashboard](frontend/farmer-dashboard/SPECIFICATION.md)** — Real-time MapLibre, irrigation scheduling, crop stress alerts.
2. **[Regulatory Portal](frontend/regulatory-portal/SPECIFICATION.md)** — Immutable audit ledger, State Engineer reporting, SLV Subdistrict compliance.
3. **[Admin Dashboard](frontend/admin-dashboard/SPECIFICATION.md)** — System-wide controls, tenant management, billing, alert configurations.
4. **[Investor Dashboard](frontend/investor-dashboard/SPECIFICATION.md)** — Aggregate metrics, Water-ROI per acre-foot, regional impact analytics.
5. **[Grant Portal](frontend/grant-portal/SPECIFICATION.md)** — Data-extraction for LOR Foundation and academic partners.
6. **[Research Portal](frontend/research-portal/SPECIFICATION.md)** — Raw variogram data, detrended residuals, historical Kriging calibration sets.
7. **[Docs Portal](frontend/docs-portal/SPECIFICATION.md)** — Static-site engineering docs, API references, installation guides.
8. **[Marketing Site](frontend/marketing-site/SPECIFICATION.md)** — Public landing page, dual-use case studies, contact forms.
