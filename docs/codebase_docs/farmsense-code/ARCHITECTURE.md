# FarmSense: System Architecture

The FarmSense infrastructure is an uncompromising, decentralized monolithic grid that functions indigenously without relying on external or public cloud services. Designed for deployment in rural, extreme weather environments, the architecture operates synchronously across multiple tiers, securing data integrity for legal auditing.

## Backend Intelligence (Decentralized Cloud Layer)

- **RSS RDC Vault (Master Database & Compute):** The central nervous system of FarmSense. It houses the master spatial library, historical datasets, and the consolidated **CSE Compute Layer**. It is responsible for executing Bayesian priors, generating deterministic "Worksheets," and pre-rendering the 1m-resolution Enterprise map tiles.

## Regional & District Edge Infrastructure

Relying entirely on external backhauls in rural Zones creates unacceptable vulnerability. Heavy computational loads process continuously at the edge:

- **Regional Superstation (RSS) [Level 3 - Territory Master]:** A localized cloud counterpart housed in a modified 40-foot High-Cube container. Features a 64-Core AMD Threadripper PRO cluster, 256GB ECC RAM, and a 50TB Enterprise NVMe array securing the master spatial database. Will support FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) Kriging modeling at **1m spatial fidelity**.
- **District Hubs (DHU) [Level 2 - Regional Mesh Manager]:** Edge coordinators mounted on 35-foot Class 4 timber poles. Line-of-sight 10km radius. Runs an **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (8GB)** for Ampere-GPU accelerated spatial processing. Capable of instant "Reflex Logic" responses bypassing cellular latency. Processes **20m and 10m spatial fidelity** grids.
  - **Audit Node Addendum**: Houses a cryptographically signed (128-bit AES) "Black Box" cache.

## Field-Level Edge Hardware

Sensors and actuators deployed below and above ground across field Zones. Subsurface equipment (LRZ/VFA) utilizes **HDPE SDR9** for maximum chemical resistance and structural rigidity, while above-ground infrastructure requires UV-shielded (fluoropolymer coated) Polycarbonate and Hybrid Pulse Capacitors (HPC) for extreme-cold -30°F survivability.

- **Vertical Field Anchors (VFA) [Level 1 - Advanced Peer Node]:** The 48-inch deep-profile central ground-truth soil node. Utilizes **HDPE SDR9** for maximum chemical resistance and impact strength in high-alkali soil. Communicates via 128-bit encrypted 900MHz LoRa Mesh directly to the elevated PMT.
- **Lateral Root-Zone Scout (LRZ) [Level 1 - Spatial Mapper]:** Mass-produced "dumb nodes" deployed at a 1:15-acre density. Utilizes identical **900MHz LoRa Mesh AES-128** networking to match VFA abilities, providing uniform field-layer state data to the PMT. Enclosures feature 50mm non-contact capacitive telemetry fields.
- **Pressure & Flow Anchor (PFA) [Sentry of the Source]:** Mounts at the wellhead, monitoring vibration torque ripple, cavitation, and bearing wear via 400A CT Clamps. Runs NXP Cortex-M7 edge processors preparing to process Current Harmonic Analysis signatures. Uses **900MHz LoRa Mesh** links to bounce data to the elevated PMT, ensuring absolute penetration through canopy interference.
- **Pivot Motion Trackers (PMT) [Level 1.5 - Field Hub & Edge-EBK Engine]:** The command center and Nervous System of the field, mounted 10-15 feet high on the pivot span.
  - **RF Umbrella:** Receives **900MHz LoRa Mesh AES-128 chirps** from the VFA, LRZs, and PFA, bundling the entire field state into a single ~187-byte AES-256 payload and beaming it to the DHU via **900MHz LoRa Mesh & LTE-M/NB-IoT failover**.
  - **Sensors:** Generates +/- 1% flow accuracy non-invasively using Badger Meter ultrasonic transit-time components. Contains u-blox ZED-F9P RTK GNSS modules for sub-2.5m horizontal spatial resolution and Bosch BNO055 9-Axis IMUs for vibration harmonics.
  - **Edge IQ**: Constant Edge-EBK processing utilizing an onboard ATSAMD51 Cortex-M4 FPU to continuously calculate a **50m spatial fidelity** EBK spatial probability grid using "Fisherman's Attention" and Ripple/Collapse logic. This constant baseline enables hierarchical processing upstream (20m/10m grids at DHU, with **1cm high-fidelity resolution** formalized as the ultimate technical objective at the RSS/Cloud layer).
  - **Corner-Swing Auditor (CSA)** variants utilize dual-node configurations (Primary Span Tracker and Swing-Arm Tracker) to resolve swing-arm irrigation mechanics mathematically.

## Dual-Layer Spatial Privacy Architecture

To comply with strict privacy laws surrounding accurate geolocation data, FarmSense segments analytics logically:

1. **Internal Legal Ledger (Absolute Precision):** Exact GPS data locked cryptographically within the DHU cache. Strictly preserved unmodified for legal evidentiary submission.
2. **Contextual Anonymization (Federated Learning):** Data uploaded for broader analysis and global model training is contextually anonymized, obfuscating individual localized geometries while maintaining regional hydro-climate validity.
