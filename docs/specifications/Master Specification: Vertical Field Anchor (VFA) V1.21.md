# Master Specification: Vertical Field Anchor (VFA) V1.21

**Role**: Layer 1 "Truth" Node & Sensor Aggregator | **Network Density**: 1 VFA per Field (Aggregating LRZs)

As the primary field-level relay and intelligence hub of the FarmSense SFD (single field deployment) architecture, the Vertical Field Anchor (VFA) operates as a high-fidelity subsurface data logger, a secure routing node, and the critical baseline calibration tool—the absolute "Truth" node—for the **Oracle Unified Compute**.

**Network Topology**: There is exactly one VFA deployed per field. The VFA is "Pinned" spatially by the high-precision PMT during the initial 24-hour calibration window, eliminating the need for internal GPS while maintaining sub-meter spatial integrity. This single VFA is responsible for intercepting the 128-bit encrypted FHSS chirps from the surrounding high-density Lateral Root-Zone (LRZ) scouts, which are deployed at a strict density of 1 unit per 15 acres.
**Subsurface Housing**: HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) SDR9 or 11. Selected for zero-degradation in high-alkali San Luis Valley mineral profiles and superior impact strength at -30°F.
 Instead of treating each data point in isolation, the solitary VFA seamlessly aggregates this expansive lateral spatial data, combines it with its own 48-inch deep-profile vertical readings, and securely routes the highly compressed, unified payload to the central Farm Hub located at the pivot. By serving as the localized edge coordinator, the VFA ensures that absolutely no data is lost during cellular blackouts. More importantly, it establishes the rigorous empirical ground truth required for ultra-precision irrigation, yield optimization, and the strict legal water-use auditing demanded by local water authorities.

**The Seasonal Deployment Model**: To maximize the lifespan of the high-value electronics, the VFA utilizes a two-phase seasonal deployment strategy. The outer structural shells act as ultra-cheap, geo-located permanent docking stations that remain buried in the field year-round. This internal, highly sensitive sensor sleds are dropped into these shells after spring planting and physically extracted just prior to harvest. This workflow entirely eliminates the risk of deep-freeze winter battery degradation while perfectly preserving the exact physical/spatial baseline required by the **RSS RDC Compute**. By maintaining this permanent sub-surface coordinate, the Oracle engine can flawlessly integrate the seasonal VFA telemetry with the static **Soil Variability Maps** during the 1m Kriging generation.

## 1. Structural Housing & Climate Control (The Seasonal Docking Station)

The VFA housing has been radically re-engineered using a dual-cylinder architecture designed to completely isolate external structural loads from the delicate internal electronics.

* **The Outer Shell (The Docking Station)**: Constructed from Standard 2" Schedule 40 UV-Stabilized HDPE (Inside Diameter: 2.067" / 52.5mm). By utilizing an exact 4-foot (48-inch) cut, the outer 2" pipe sits completely flush with the soil surface. This shell stays in the ground over the winter, resisting sub-zero frost-shatter.
* **Low-Profile Antenna Mount**: The removable C&C Cap mounts a 3-foot SS-304 stainless steel whip antenna directly to its base via a heavy-duty spring. This gives the VFA an exact 3-foot profile above the soil, minimizing collision risk with tractor booms while remaining highly visible to the elevated PMT hub overhead.
* **Monolithic Chemical Fix (HDPE-to-HDPE)**: The outer shell is paired with a Custom HDPE Tapered Driving Tip, chemically fused using low-surface-energy Structural HDPE Acrylic Epoxy.
* **The Removable Internal Sled**: The core internal structure is a 48-Inch 50mm Co-Extruded Alpha-Sled capped with precision Injection-Molded Circular End-Caps. This sled acts as a robust internal spine, clamping the 48U sequence of modular cartridges.
* **The Seasonal Climate (+5 psi Defense)**: Upon seasonal insertion, Viton (FKM) 2" O-rings seal the sled against the shell walls. The internal cavity is flushed and pressurized to +5 psi with Dry Nitrogen, creating an inert, zero-humidity environment that acts as an active defense against micro-fractures and groundwater ingress.

## 2. Custom Relay Logic & Encryption (The Hub Pipeline)

By stripping the VFA down to pure routing and encryption functions, we have intentionally offloaded all heavy cellular backhaul requirements and complex computations to the central Farm Hub and the **Command & Control (C&C)** backend.

* **Interference Mitigation & FHSS**: The VFA utilizes a highly sensitive onboard FHSS mesh receiver to intercept the transmit-only "dumb" chirps from its fleet of 15-acre LRZs.
* **Firmware Logic & Interrupts**: Operates an RTOS prioritizing pressure transients (Priority 0) over mesh coordination (Priority 1) and ADC dielectric sampling (Priority 2).
* **Edge Decryption & Aggregation**: As the VFA catches these asynchronous chirps, it performs localized Edge Decryption, aggregating the raw electrical counts from the 15-acre lateral nodes with its own high-fidelity deep-soil data.
* **Hardware Security & Root of Trust (RoT)**: Private Keys are generated within the nRF52840's secure hardware enclave (CryptoCell). It is injected at the RSS and never leaves the silicon.
* **Integrated LoRa Mesh & 2.4GHz Transceiver**: The VFA utilizes a **Nordic nRF52840** combined with a **Semtech SX1262** transceiver. This enables participation in the district-wide LoRa Mesh managed by the PMT. It also incorporates BLE 5.0 for localized research access and PFA safety coordination.
  * **Processing**: nRF52840 (Cortex-M4F @ 64MHz) for ultra-low power soil profiling.
  * **Protocol**: 900MHz LoRa Mesh (Spread Spectrum).
  * **Encryption**: AES-256 (ESP32 Hardware Accelerator).
  * **Networking Ability**: Synchronized 1:1 with PMT/DHU for uniform field-layer data reporting.
  * Output Power: +22dBm (Max LoRa). Sensitivity: -148dBm (Max LoRa). Modulated for 100% penetration through potato/corn canopies.
  * **Antenna**: Flush-mount 3-foot flexible 900MHz whip (Internalized).

## 3. The "Proxy Method" Sensor Array (48-Inch / 48U Sequence)

The VFA employs advanced non-contact sensing, shooting high-frequency dielectric fields directly through the removable 50mm sled wall, across the nitrogen gap, and straight through the permanent HDPE shell.
