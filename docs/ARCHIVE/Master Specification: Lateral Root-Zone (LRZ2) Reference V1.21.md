# Master Specification: Lateral Root-Zone (LRZ2) Reference V1.21

**Role**: Layer 1 Lateral Root-Zone **Reference** | **Network Density**: 4 units per 140-160 acre Field (2:4:12 Stereo Standard)

The Lateral Root-Zone **Reference** (LRZ2) serves as the high-density spatial mapper of the FarmSense network. Deployed at a density of 5 units per 150-acre field, these mass-produced **Dumb Node** References provide the granular moisture and temperature counts required to translate field-wide trends into sub-meter soil variability maps.
 They do not process complex Worksheets or execute localized Bayesian math. They do not carry on-board GPS; instead, they are "Pinned" to the regional map by the PMT's RTK-GNSS anchor as it transits the field. This "Pin Mapping" ensures that every moisture data point is accurately geofenced with sub-meter precision. Their sole operational imperative is to capture raw dielectric and electrical conductivity (EC) counts across their specific zone, encrypt them, and "chirp" them back to the **PMT Field Aggregator** anchored on the pivot. This massive density of spatial data is what ultimately powers the FarmSense UI and **Command & Control (C&C)** logic—allowing the system to mathematically transition from the Free (50m) and Basic (20m) tiers to the highly lucrative Pro (10m) and Enterprise (1m) resolution "pops."

**The Seasonal Deployment Model**: To protect the LRZ's internal electronics and guarantee a 10-year hardware lifecycle, FarmSense utilizes a two-phase seasonal deployment strategy. The outer structural shells act as ultra-cheap, geo-located permanent docking stations that remain buried in the field year-round. The internal, highly sensitive sensor sleds are dropped into these shells after spring planting and physically extracted just prior to harvest. This workflow entirely eliminates the risk of deep-freeze winter battery degradation while perfectly preserving the exact physical/spatial baseline required by the **RSS RDC Compute**. By maintaining this permanent sub-surface coordinate, the Oracle engine can flawlessly integrate the seasonal LRZ telemetry with the static **Soil Variability Maps** during the 1m Kriging generation.

## 1. Structural Housing ("Invisible Presence" Architecture & Seasonal Docking)

The LRZ housing is engineered for an "Invisible Presence"—a ruggedized subterranean deployment capable of withstanding the extreme mechanical stresses of 4WD tractor passes and repetitive deep-soil compaction cycles common in potato-barley rotations.

* **The Outer Shell (The Docking Station)**: Constructed from Standard 2" HDPE SDR9 (High-Albedo White). Cut precisely to 18 inches to perfectly match the internal 18U sled, this shell sits perfectly flush with the soil surface.
* **Material Science**: White HDPE was selected specifically for its high albedo (thermal reflection) to prevent internal components from baking during surface exposure. HDPE is also chemically inert to the sulfur-rich SLV alkali soils.
* **Installation Efficiency**: By keeping the shell at exactly 18 inches, the hydraulic auger crews only need to drill a shallow pilot hole, exponentially speeding up installation.
* **15-Degree Tapered Driving Tip (Compaction-Fit)**: The 18-inch outer shell is chemically fused to a Custom HDPE Driving Tip featuring a precise 15-degree taper, eliminating air gaps that corrupt moisture readings.
* **Low-Profile Antenna Mount**: The removable **Wide-Brim Solar Cap** (4"-5" diameter) replaces the standard C&C Cap, integrating a flexible solar panel to enable **Solar-Enhanced Mode** (4-8 chirps/day). Mounts a 3-foot SS-304 stainless steel whip antenna. Below-span height maintained.
* **The Removable Internal Sled**: The core internal structure is an 18-Inch 50mm Co-Extruded Alpha-Sled capped with Injection-Molded Circular End-Caps. This removable payload is swiftly inserted post-planting and extracted pre-harvest.
* **The Seasonal Climate (+5 psi Defense)**: Upon insertion, Viton (FKM) 2" O-rings seal the sled against the shell walls. The internal cavity is flushed and pressurized to +5 psi with Dry Nitrogen for active protection against micro-fractures.

## 2. Edge Logic & The Secure "Chirp" Protocol

The LRZ is an exercise in extreme power efficiency. It lacks the eMMC storage and heavy compute processors found in edge coordinators. It is a "Set and Forget" asset that awakens, acts, and sleeps.

* **Ultra-Low Power ASR6601 Logic**: The compute board relies on the ASR6601 LoRa SoC (Cortex-M4 + Semtech SX1262 LoRa). This chip stays in a deep 1.5µA sleep state for 99% of its life.
* **Fringe Field Physics**: Wakens to sample the dielectric interface using a direct analog measurement via P0.02 (AIN0) and P0.03 (AIN1), pulling 5mA for 1.0ms.
* **900MHz LoRa Mesh Implementation:** The LRZ units execute 128- **Protocol**: 900MHz LoRa Mesh (Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum)

* **Encryption**: AES-128 CCM (Authenticated Encryption)

* **Networking Ability**: Synchronized 1:1 with VFA/PFA for uniform field-layer data reporting.
d. By scattering micro-transmissions across 75 different frequencies, the system ensures superior penetration through dense crop canopies and mitigates co-channel interference, completely eliminating the probability of packet collisions within the confines of a single high-density farm field.

* **128-Bit Edge Encryption**: Before the chirp leaves the antenna, the payload is signed and encrypted with a factory-burned 128-bit AES key. The **PMT aggregator** intercepts and decrypts this packet for routing. (Transmit draws 55mA for 50ms).
* **Oracle Unified Compute Remote Calibration**: The LRZ2 requires zero manual calibration. Its baseline is established remotely by the **Oracle Unified Compute** using the high-fidelity Bayesian math from the field's VFA "Foundation Node."

## 3. The High-Density Sensor Array (18-Inch / 18U Sequence)

Like the VFA, the LRZ employs the advanced "Proxy Method" of non-contact sensing, shooting high-frequency dielectric fields directly through the 50mm sled wall, the nitrogen gap, and the permanent HDPE shell.

**Locked 18U Physical Stack Sequence**:

* **Slot 1**: 1U Bulk Stamped Desiccant Pack (Growing season moisture trap)
* **Slots 2-5**: 4U Battery #1 (3x 21700 lithium-ion cells - Optimized for 5+ year seasonal cycling)
* **Slots 6-9**: 4U Extruded Spacer
* **Slot 10**: 1U Basic Sensor (10" Depth: Seedbed & Evapotranspiration Monitoring)
* **Slots 11-14**: 4U Battery #2 (Redundant energy overhead for extended seasonal sampling ripples)
* **Slots 15-17**: 3U Extruded Spacer
* **Slot 18**: 1U Basic Sensor (18" Depth: Root Anchor Monitoring)

## 4. The Seasonal Deployment Workflow & OEM Scale BOM

**The "Blitz" Installation & Extraction Cycle**:

1. **Post-Planting Insertion**: Utilizing a three-crew rotation, installation is calculated at under 10 minutes per unit. Crew A drills/sets the shell, Crew B drops/pressurizes the sled, and Crew C performs final compaction.
2. **Harvest Extraction**: Prior to harvest, crews extract the internal sleds and cap the permanent shells with crush-proof blanking plugs.
