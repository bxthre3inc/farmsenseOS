# FarmSense: Master Development Plan

## 1. Executive Vision: The Global Water Ledger

FarmSense is the definitive sovereign water infrastructure—legally recognized, cryptographically secure, and scientifically absolute. Our mission is to replace stochastic, intuition-based agricultural practices with a high-fidelity, rule-based computational engine that serves as the "Global Water Ledger."

### Core Philosophy: Deterministic Farming

- **MAD Framework:** Implementation of Management Allowable Depletion (MAD) to treat soil as a "battery," mathematically eliminating deep percolation and water wastage.
- **Legal Defense:** A decentralized, unbreakable 128-bit AES cryptographic chain of custody for water rights evidence in State Water Courts.
- **Economic Optimization:** Continuous Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) preventing irrigation when marginal pumping cost exceeds marginal yield revenue.

## 2. Technical Architecture Baseline

### 2.1. Hierarchical Processing Stack

1. **Level 1 (Field):** **LRZ/VFA** (FHSS chirps) -> **PMT Hub** (50m Grid, EBK baseline).
2. **Level 2 (District):** **DHUs** (OnLogic ARM SOC) -> 20m/10m Grid (Go-based IDW).
3. **Level 3 (Regional):** **RSS** (64-Core Threadripper) -> 1m Grid (Python-based Regression Kriging + FHE).
4. **Level 4 (Global):** **Zo.computer Cloud** -> Multi-field analytics, Federated Learning.

### 2.2. Core Software Components

- **Backend:** FastAPI (async), PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB (Time-series), PostGIS (Spatial), Redis (Cache), RabbitMQ (Queue).
- **Edge Computing:** Go-optimized IDW interpolation with offline SQLite resilience.
- **Cloud Analytics:** NumPy/SciPy Regression Kriging incorporating Sentinel-2/Landsat-9 imagery.
- **Security:** JWT Authentication, 128-bit AES payload encryption, Secure Element (SE) chip integration (planned).
