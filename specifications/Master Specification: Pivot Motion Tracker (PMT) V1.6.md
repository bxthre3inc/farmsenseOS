# Master Specification: Pivot Motion Tracker (PMT) V1.6

Role: Field Hub (DHU Uplink) & Hydraulic Auditor | Network Density: 1 per Pivot (Subdistrict 1 Deployment)

The Pivot Motion Tracker (PMT) serves as the high-fidelity "Nervous System" and the primary

"Hydraulic Auditor" of the FarmSense SFD (Single Field Deployment) architecture. Positioned

externally on the main span of a center-pivot irrigation machine, it provides the essential

kinematic and hydraulic flow data required to verify exactly where, when, and how much water

is applied to the land. While the LRZ (Lateral Root-Zone) scouts monitor the soil's response to

water, the PMT provides the certified proof of application, completing the data loop for the Zo

Scientist Engine and establishing the legal foundation for the "Digital Water Ledger."

Subdistrict 1 Economics & Strategic Procurement: This version of the specification reflects

the optimized procurement strategy for the 1,280-unit deployment in Subdistrict 1. At this

scale, FarmSense leverages high-volume industrial discounts from established, reliable

suppliers (such as Polycase, SparkFun, and Badger Meter) rather than attempting full custom

silicon integration at this stage. This ensures immediate field reliability, insurance-backed

liability protection, and professional-grade accuracy for Water Court auditing.

## 1. Structural Housing & "Cut-Less" Mounting Logistics

Because the PMT is an above-ground asset mounted directly to massive moving steel

machinery, it faces extreme environmental stressors: intense high-altitude UV, 100mph alpine

wind gusts, and continuous sand-blasting from alkali dust.

The Enclosure (RF-Transparent Architecture): Housed in an IP67 UV-Stabilized

Polycarbonate Box (8"x6"x4") from Polycase.

Material Logic: Polycarbonate provides superior impact resistance, ensuring the unit

survives accidental strikes from low-hanging branches or pivot hardware. It is also

inherently RF-transparent, allowing the internal high-precision GNSS and BLE antennas

to maintain high-gain locks without the need for fragile externalized "puck" antennas

that are prone to being sheared off during operation.

Environmental Defense: The enclosure features a dual-stage Gore-Tex breather vent.

During rapid alpine temperature drops (e.g., a 40°F drop during a sudden storm), this

prevents the box from creating an internal vacuum that would suck in moisture-laden

outside air through the gaskets, causing catastrophic condensation on the logic

boards.

"Cut-Less" Mounting (Zero-Impact Integration): Attached to the main galvanized pivot

span (typically 6.625" or 8.625" OD) using heavy-duty 304 Stainless Steel "Band-It"

straps combined with a Neoprene Friction Pad.

Structural Integrity: This non-invasive mount requires zero drilling, welding, or tapping

into the pivot's span, preserving the manufacturer's structural warranty and preventing

point-source corrosion. The Neoprene pad acts as a critical vibration dampener,

isolating the sensitive IMU and GNSS electronics from the rhythmic mechanical

"clanking" of the pivot's electric drive motors and gearboxes.

## 2. Kinematic Positioning & Structural Audit Stack

The PMT moves beyond simple GPS tracking to professional-grade kinematic auditing,

differentiating mathematically between "Walking" (motion without water) and "Pumping."

High-Precision GNSS Engine (RTK-Ready): Utilizes a u-blox ZED-F9P RTK GNSS

module sourced via SparkFun.

Spatial Precision: By simultaneously tracking multiple satellite constellations (GPS,

GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou), the PMT maintains sub-2.5m horizontal accuracy even

during heavy cloud cover or atmospheric thermal shimmer.

The 1m "Resolution Pop": This precision data is the empirical backbone of the

FarmSense UI. By correlating the PMT's location with subsurface LRZ pings, the Zo

Math Engine calculates exactly which 1-meter tile received water. If a Basic Tier (20m)

user attempts to zoom in, the PMT's underlying high-fidelity data triggers the

"Resolution Pop," initiating a pricing funnel for the Enterprise upgrade by showcasing

the granular insight currently being "audited" in the background.

9-Axis IMU (The "Crabbing" & Structural Sentry): A Bosch BNO055 Inertial

Measurement Unit continuously monitors vibration harmonics and 3D orientation.

Diagnostic Intelligence: It detects "Crabbing"—a dangerous condition where a tower's

drive motor slips or stalls in deep mud, causing the massive steel span to bow and drift

out of alignment. If crabbing or abnormal vibration is detected, the PMT alerts the Hub,

which can immediately command the PFA (Pressure & Flow Anchor) to execute a

"Soft-Stop" of the well pump, preventing catastrophic, $80,000+ structural collapses.

## 3. Non-Invasive Hydraulic Flow Stack (The Audit Engine)

The hydraulic flow stack is the primary engine for water rights verification and state-level

regulatory compliance.

Ultrasonic Transit-Time Transducers: Utilizes a Badger Meter TFX-5000 clamp-on

transducer pair.

Physics of Flow: These sensors utilize "Transit-Time" logic, measuring the nanosecond

difference between ultrasonic pulses traveling upstream vs. downstream. This

<https://gemini.google.com/app/7d9f7fc3aa518d8b> 2/5

2/21/26, 1:20 AM Google Gemini

difference is directly proportional to the water's flow velocity.

The "Cut-Less" Advantage: Because these clamp to the outside of the 8" main pipe,

they require zero pipe cutting or downtime. Most importantly, they ensure zero

pressure drop in the hydraulic system. Unlike invasive paddle-wheel meters that

create drag, this non-invasive approach preserves the energy efficiency of the well

pump, saving the farmer thousands in seasonal energy costs.

Legal Certification: The system provides ±1.0% flow accuracy, meeting the "Gold

Standard" required for verified water use reporting to the State Engineer and securing

long-term water rights through empirical proof.

## 4. Edge Processing & Winter Hibernation Logic

Cortex-M4 Processing Sled: Features an ATSAMD51 processing sled (sourced via Digi

Key). It buffers 1-second interval flow data and GNSS coordinates, applying a localized

Kalman Filter to the IMU data to smooth out the intense vibration noise of the pivot spans.

Comms (The Field Hub): Features a dual-radio stack. Transmits and receives via a High-Gain 900MHz FHSS antenna to act as the primary "listening post" for the field's LRZ & VFA mesh. It then intercepts this data, bundles it with its own 2.4GHz/BLE hydraulic payload, and blasts the entire field's encrypted payload via a 900MHz LoRaWAN transceiver to the District Hub (DHU).

**Bayesian Edge-Kriging & VRI Failover Operations:**
In the event of a DHU uplink failure, the PMT acts as an autonomous "Local Zo Engine." Utilizing the ATSAMD51's 120MHz hardware Floating-Point Unit (FPU), the PMT intercept the 11 mesh data points and calculates a 50m-resolution spatial probability grid (a 16x16 matrix across the 160-acre quarter section).

- **Dynamic Update Frequency (The "Fisherman's Attention" Scale & Spatial Ripples):** The PMT governs its processing overhead using a 4-tier adaptive scaling logic modeled after a fisherman watching a bobber, coupled with dynamic spatial targeting:
  1. **Dormant Baseline (4-Hour Sweeps):** When the weather is stable, soil moisture is high, and the pivot is parked, the PMT "relaxes," calculating the 16x16 field matrix only once every 4 hours.
  2. **Anticipatory Watch (1-Hour Sweeps):** If the PMT knows active evaporation factors are rising (e.g., sunrise, temperature climbing), it pays closer attention, increasing the grid calculation to every 60 minutes.
  3. **Active Anomaly Tracking (15-Minute Sweeps) & Spatial Ripples:** The moment the PMT gets a "nibble"—detecting the first sign of a rapid statistical trend from a specific LRZ/VFA node—it scales updates to 15 minutes. Crucially, this triggers a **"Focus Ripple."** The PMT actively commands the peer nodes radially radiating outward from the anomaly to increase their chirp frequency, mapping the physical spread of the event in real-time.
  4. **Significant Event (5-Second Sweeps) & Spatial Collapse:** When the "fish bites" (a critical threshold is breached) OR the water is actively moving (the pivot span begins its transit), the system completely overrides the global baseline. To conserve its limited solar battery buffer while maintaining absolute precision, the PMT triggers a **"Focus Collapse."** Instead of repeatedly calculating the entire 160-acre matrix every 5 seconds, the PMT intentionally ignores the dormant parts of the field. It collapses its computational power exclusively onto the trajectory of the active event—such as the path directly ahead of the watering pivot span, or the epicenter of a soil anomaly—to guide immediate VRI corrections. As the pivot parks or the event stabilizes, the collapse radially expands back into a ripple, eventually reinstating the Dormant Baseline across the entire field.
- **Failover Logic:** The PMT uses this dynamic 50m grid to execute autonomous Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) speed commands, speeding up or slowing down the pivot, and actuating PFA safety valves if critical water deficits are detected within the Focus Range.
- **Data Buffering:** During the outage, the PMT logs the 187-byte payloads to its onboard SPI Flash, burst-transmitting the backlog the absolute second the DHU connection is restored to maintain an unbroken State Engineer audit trail.

Winter Hibernation & "Warm Start": Powered by an integrated 10W Solar Lid + LiFePO4

Buffer from Renogy. To survive the 120-day SLV winter dormancy under 2 feet of snow, the

PMT includes a Saft LS14500 LiSOCl2 5yr Hibernation Pack.

RTC Maintenance: This primary cell keeps the GNSS Real-Time Clock alive all winter.

This ensures that when the pivot is first powered in the spring, it achieves a "Warm

Start" GNSS lock in under 5 seconds, providing an unbroken audit trail for the season's

first gallon.
